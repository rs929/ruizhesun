                <p>I am a current junior studying Computer Science and minoring in Data Science at Cornell University, and over the past 3 years, I have honed my skills in software engineering through personal projects, project team contributions,  and a dedication to staying current with industry trends and best practices. </p>
                <br></br>
                <p>In my current role as developer and course instructor at <span className='cornell'>Cornell AppDev</span>, I have not only honed my skills in software development, but also Iâ€™ve been able to thrive in a collaborative environment and develop my leadership skills in guiding and mentoring a large class of students. I am a self-motivated individual who is always eager to learn new skills, and I am looking for opportunities to apply my academic knowledge and further explore my passions in Software Engineering.</p>
                <br></br>
                <p>In my free time, I like drawing, making origami, swimming, hiking, and playing violin.</p>
